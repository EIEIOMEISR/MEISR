## Our Goal

The Measure of Engagement, Independence, and Social Relationships (MEISR) produces a profile of a childâ€™s functioning in home and community routines. Our goal was to improve accessiblity of the MEISR survey and automate data analysis for The Evidence-based International Early Intervention Office (EIEIO). We accomplished this by digitizing the survey and processing results into a database.
